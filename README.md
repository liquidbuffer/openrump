=OpenRump=

An open source physics based sex game.

==Prerequisits==

* You must manually copy your shared library build of
  "RenderSystem GL" to the folder "res/plugins". This
  file is built when you build (or download a prebuilt
  version of) Ogre3D.

* Assets are not part of the project due to copyright
  limitations. They are loaded externally from one
  directory level above the root directory in a folder
  called "openrump-assets" when building in debug.
  You can obtain a copy of these files from the
  project leader via e-mailing: liquidbuffer@gmail.com

* It is recommended to build and install the dependencies
  into the folder "dep/build" rather than installing them
  globally.  The build system will be able to pick on them.
  - NOTE: Build system is currently fucked.
